1
00:01:08,222 --> 00:01:14,053
A technician can make a diagnosis
but it costs 15 euros plus VAT.

2
00:01:14,054 --> 00:01:17,650
It has become difficult
to find parts for this.

3
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:20,225
It's not worth repairing.

4
00:01:20,226 --> 00:01:22,900
Repair will cost 110-120 euros.

5
00:01:22,905 --> 00:01:25,550
Printers cost as low as 39 euros.

6
00:01:25,555 --> 00:01:28,400
I would advise you buy a new printer.

7
00:01:28,405 --> 00:01:31,158
It's best to buy a new one.

8
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,500
We live in a society dominated
by a growth economy

9
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:07,500
whose logic is not creating because we
need things, but just for the sake of it.

10
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,916
Man decided to shorten a
products lifespan to 1000 hours.

11
00:06:05,835 --> 00:06:08,950
Christmas Eve 1924 was a special day.

12
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:15,924
In a backroom in Geneve, suit wearing
men met to create a secret plan.

13
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:21,500
They established the
first worldwide cartel.

14
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,766
Their goal was to control
the production of lightbulbs

15
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:30,385
and to divide the world
market between them.

16
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:34,256
The cartel was called Phoebus.

17
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,227
They would change the patents,
control the production

18
00:06:49,227 --> 00:06:52,327
and above all control consumption.

19
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:59,300
It is better for the companies that
bulbs must be changed more often.

20
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,300
Long lasting lights are an
economic disadvantage.

21
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:55,266
Phoebus decided to limit the lifespan
of a light bulb to 1000 hours.

22
00:07:58,927 --> 00:08:04,705
In 1925 they appointed a group
called "The 1000 Hour Life Committee",

23
00:08:04,705 --> 00:08:12,201
that would technically reduce the time
an incandescent lamp could burn.

24
00:08:32,495 --> 00:08:37,195
Here we have a cartel document:

25
00:09:17,927 --> 00:09:25,900
One measure was to set up
a stand with many shelves

26
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,036
to which different types of
lightbulbs were connected to

27
00:09:31,036 --> 00:09:38,584
so that the company Osram was able
to register how long they lasted.

28
00:09:55,535 --> 00:10:00,835
Here we have a list of fines from 1929.

29
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:07,913
It shows how many Swiss
Francs companies had to pay

30
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:14,816
for example, here when the life
of a bulb was about 1500 hours.

31
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,677
Officially, Phoebus never existed, although
it's tracks have always been there.

32
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:40,914
The strategy has been to
constantly change names.

33
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:47,112
They used the name
"The International Energy Cartel" and others.

34
00:11:47,112 --> 00:11:52,021
The point is that this idea
as an institution still exists.

35
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:03,036
Growth Society's logic is not
only to grow to meet demand

36
00:23:03,036 --> 00:23:08,966
but to grow for the sake of growth;
unbounded growth in production

37
00:23:08,966 --> 00:23:14,736
that is justified through the
boundless growth in consumption.

38
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:31,980
The three crucial factors are advertising,
planned obsolescence and credit.

39
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,103
Anyone who thinks that infinite
growth is consistent with a finite planet

40
00:24:05,103 --> 00:24:08,890
is either crazy, or an economist.

41
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:12,989
The problem is that now
we've all become economists.

42
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:38,407
With this Growth Society we
are sitting in a racing car

43
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:44,894
that no longer has a driver,
is running at full speed

44
00:24:44,894 --> 00:24:52,206
and will end up crashing
into a wall or driving off a cliff.

45
00:25:42,327 --> 00:25:49,727
I have found the chip called an EEPROM,
which stores a preset number of prints.

46
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:56,524
When the user reaches this preset
number of prints, the printer locks up.

47
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,645
I bought this DDR-fridge in 1985.

48
00:31:28,645 --> 00:31:32,942
It is 24 years old.

49
00:31:32,942 --> 00:31:39,829
The light bulb is the same age,
I have never changed it. It is 25 years old.

50
00:31:55,500 --> 00:32:03,517
In 1981 when the East Germans
presented the bulb at a fair in Hanover,

51
00:32:03,517 --> 00:32:07,498
our colleagues in the West said,
"You will make yourselves unemployed."

52
00:32:07,498 --> 00:32:14,343
East Germans engineers
replied, "On the contrary."

53
00:32:14,343 --> 00:32:20,294
"By saving resources and not wasting
tungsten we will keep our jobs.""

54
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:42,093
The transport sector would
pay the actual costs of shipping,

55
00:45:42,093 --> 00:45:47,592
not to mention the fact
that oil is unrenewable,

56
00:45:47,592 --> 00:45:52,662
if the current price was
multiplied by 20 or 30.

57
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:32,871
'Environment' is generally linked to
saving, reduction, zero waste, etc.

58
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:40,269
But nature doesn't save anything, for
example when a cherry tree blossoms.

59
00:46:56,564 --> 00:47:01,864
Nature produces no waste,
only nutrients.

60
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:23,368
Imagine a sofa or a chair
with a fabric like this;

61
00:47:23,368 --> 00:47:30,220
it's decorations are so toxic that it
must be handled as hazardous waste.

62
00:47:51,567 --> 00:47:59,467
Now we select edible materials. You should
be able to have this with your muesli.

63
00:47:59,467 --> 00:48:04,111
In a waste-based society,
products will cause problems.

64
00:48:04,311 --> 00:48:10,718
But if manufactureres use nutrients, the
products can become something new.

65
00:48:22,401 --> 00:48:27,001
A true revolution requires
a cultural change,

66
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:30,954
a paradigm shift and
a change in mentality.

67
00:48:42,234 --> 00:48:49,634
Anti-Growth is a provocative
slogan that will break

68
00:48:49,634 --> 00:48:56,754
the way of thought that considers infine
growth to be possible and sustainable.

69
00:48:56,754 --> 00:49:01,186
It marks the necessity
to change our logic.

70
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:12,420
The main message of anti-growth is
to reduce our environmental footprint,

71
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:17,157
our waste, overproduction
and overconsumption.

72
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:22,844
By reducing production and
consumption we get more free time

73
00:49:22,844 --> 00:49:30,638
to develop other forms of
wealth that can't be exhausted,

74
00:49:30,638 --> 00:49:34,604
for example friendship
and learning.

75
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:03,692
If happiness was dependent
on our consumption level,

76
00:50:03,692 --> 00:50:06,982
we should be 100% content.

77
00:50:06,982 --> 00:50:11,893
We consume 26 times more
than in Marx's time.

78
00:50:11,893 --> 00:50:16,227
But all studies show that people
are not 20 times happier.

79
00:50:16,227 --> 00:50:19,366
For happiness is always subjective.

80
00:50:33,369 --> 00:50:40,469
To return to a society of
sustainable development

81
00:50:40,469 --> 00:50:48,363
is not to go back to the
Stone Age, but to the 1960s.

82
00:50:48,363 --> 00:50:51,498
It is far from the Stone Age.

83
00:50:53,083 --> 00:50:57,483
Anti-Growth Society
meets Ghandi's vision:

84
00:50:57,483 --> 00:51:02,895
"The world is big enough to
satisfy everyone's needs,"

85
00:51:02,895 --> 00:51:09,839
"but will always be too small
to satisfy individual greed."
